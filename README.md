# nhltoolbarmac
just tryin out [rumps](https://rumps.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html)

## Currently Implemented
- tells you score for previous Pens game (no current games due to suspended season, so hard to test)
- update score
- toggle auto updates
- score in toolbar
- current pd, time left in menu
- future games!
- days until future games
- time zone magic (time until is calculated by time zone of home team, not of user)

## Planned Updates
- get local time zone / let user set time zone (for days until)
- make it work for next/current pens games (can't test without games!!!)
- add standings
- generalize to work for any teams lmao (honestly? optional)
- add more info (penalty box, goaltender, maybe who's on the ice?? maybe too much)
- notifications for goals???? (delta score)
- notifications for intermission, start of period, end of period, OT, SO, etc)
- possibly notifications for penalties?? check api to see if this is possible
- add multiple teams?
- add icons
- make separate functions damnit
- fix auto-updates (this will probably require lots of moving shit around)
- settings
- weep
